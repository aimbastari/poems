Making beats, beats reality
I ask my kids to get a job

They say they can't because 
"we are Making Beats"

Making music? 
I dont see any instruments
Does anyone know how to play an instrument?

Hell no.  
We just download stuff from the web
Samples.
Then we move these knobs here and there
on the laptop

And voila Beats.
Do you like it?
Can you Hear the Kick? 

Dead beats. 
The only Kick I would like to hear
is the kick in the a...
they will receive when

I finally decide to kick them out of the house.
