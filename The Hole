My friend got cancer last year
said his wife gave it to him
on account of all the poison she fed him
mental poison

Now he has a hole in his cheek
wont heal
the band-aids keep getting bigger
now he's got two bandaids to cover the oozing.

The hole keeps getting larger
everytime i see him
His wife and kids are eating him alive
with all the demands 

Demands for college tuition
Demands for new cars
to keep up with the rest
Never allowing time for healing

The hole will swallow him whole
and they won't even care when he is gone
down the eternal rabbit-hole
to rest in peace...
